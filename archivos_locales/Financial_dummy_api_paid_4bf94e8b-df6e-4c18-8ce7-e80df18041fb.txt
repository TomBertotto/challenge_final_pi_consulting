FinFlow Pro API Master Service Agreement (Commercial) Version 4.2 | Last Updated: January 30, 2026  1. Commercial Binding Agreement This Master Service Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legally binding contract between FinFlow Systems Inc. ("FinFlow") and the entity or person purchasing a commercial subscription ("Subscriber," "Customer," or "You").  By clicking "I Accept," paying a subscription invoice, or initiating a call to the https://api.finflow.pro/v1/ endpoints, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind your organization to these terms. Strictly no non-commercial, hobbyist, or free-tier usage is permitted under this endpoint.  2. Commercial Licensing & Scope of Use FinFlow grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to integrate the API into commercial applications, proprietary trading platforms, or client-facing fintech products, subject to the following:  Revenue-Generating Use: Unlike our sandbox tier, this license expressly permits the use of FinFlow data in products that charge fees, contain advertisements, or serve as the backbone of a for-profit enterprise.  Authorized Users: Access is restricted to the specific number of "Seats" or "Internal Developers" specified in your Sales Order.  Territorial Limits: Unless otherwise specified in a custom Addendum, this license is granted for use within the jurisdiction of the Customer’s primary place of business.  3. Payment Terms and Financial Obligations Access to the Commercial API is contingent upon the timely payment of fees.  Subscription Fees: Fees are billed in advance (Monthly or Annually). Failure to process a payment will result in the immediate suspension of the API Key.  Overage Charges: If your application exceeds the "Requests Per Minute" (RPM) or "Requests Per Month" (RPMo) allocated in your tier, FinFlow will automatically bill you for the excess usage at the current market rate plus a 15% administrative surcharge.  No Refunds: Due to the real-time nature of financial data delivery, all fees paid are non-refundable, regardless of whether the API was utilized during the billing cycle.  Tax Responsibilities: Customer is responsible for all applicable sales, use, or value-added taxes (VAT) associated with the subscription.  4. Proprietary Rights and Data Ownership The API: FinFlow owns all rights to the API architecture, the documentation, and the proprietary "cleaning" algorithms used to normalize market data.  Derived Data: You may create "Derived Data" (e.g., a proprietary volatility index calculated using our price feed). While you own the logic of the index, you may not redistribute the underlying raw FinFlow data points to third parties without a Redistribution License.  Feedback: If you provide suggestions or "bug reports," you grant FinFlow a perpetual, irrevocable license to use that feedback without compensation.  5. Stringent Commercial Restrictions To maintain market stability and comply with global financial regulations (including GDPR and Dodd-Frank implications), the following acts are strictly prohibited:  White-Labeling: You may not re-sell the API as your own "Financial Data Engine" to third-party developers.  High-Frequency Trading (HFT): Unless you have signed a "Low-Latency Addendum," this API is not rated for HFT. Using standard commercial keys for millisecond-level arbitrage is a breach of the Fair Use policy.  Database Reconstruction: You may not systematically download and store our entire historical database to create a competing data product.  Credential Sharing: Sharing API keys between different legal entities, even if they are subsidiaries, is prohibited without a "Multi-Entity" corporate plan.  6. Service Level Agreement (SLA) & Uptime FinFlow recognizes that for commercial clients, downtime equals lost revenue.  Uptime Commitment: We guarantee 99.9% uptime during any given calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows (usually Sundays 02:00–04:00 UTC).  Service Credits: If uptime falls below 99.0%, Customer is eligible for a credit equal to 10% of that month’s subscription fee, provided a claim is filed within 30 days of the outage.  Maintenance: FinFlow will provide at least 48 hours' notice for any non-emergency maintenance that might impact API availability.  7. Security and Audit Rights Security Standards: Customer must implement industry-standard security (OAuth 2.0 / TLS 1.3) to protect the data transit between their servers and FinFlow.  Audit Rights: FinFlow reserves the right to audit Customer’s API logs and implementation (remotely or on-site with 7 days' notice) to ensure compliance with the Commercial License. If an audit reveals underpayment or unlicensed use, Customer shall pay the costs of the audit plus all back-dated fees.  8. Confidentiality During the term of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" (including API documentation marked as private, pricing sheets, and roadmap previews) must be protected. You agree to use the same degree of care—but no less than reasonable care—to protect this information as you do your own.
