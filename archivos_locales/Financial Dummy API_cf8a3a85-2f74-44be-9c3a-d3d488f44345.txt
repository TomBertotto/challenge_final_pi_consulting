You must contact our Sales Team for a Commercial Enterprise License.  3. Grant of License Subject to your continued compliance with these terms, FinFlow grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to:  Access the API to fetch financial data (stock quotes, ledger balances, transaction histories).
