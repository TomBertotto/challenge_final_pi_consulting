Contemporary Archive: Terms of Access and Licensing
Version 7.4 | Revision Date: February 3, 2026

1. Scope of the Contemporary Archive
The Contemporary Archive (the "Database") is a curated repository of metadata, abstracts, and full-text digital objects pertaining to literary works published from 1945 to the present. By accessing the Database, you (the "User") acknowledge that you are entering a space governed by strict international copyright treaties, including the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the Berne Convention.

2. User Categories and Access Levels
Access to contemporary literature requires a tiered approach to ensure authors and publishers receive due compensation:

Tier 1: General Public (Free): Allows for the viewing of "Public Metadata" (Title, Author, ISBN, Publication Date) and limited "Snippet View" (up to 50 words) for search verification purposes.

Tier 2: Academic/Institutional (Paid/Subscribed): Allows full-text access for verified students and faculty of subscribing universities. Use is strictly for non-commercial research and classroom instruction.

Tier 3: Commercial/Professional (Paid): For publishers, literary agents, and film scouts looking to perform deep-data analysis on literary trends or rights availability.

3. Intellectual Property and Digital Rights Management (DRM)
The works within this Database are not in the public domain.

The "Post-1945" Rule: Most works in the Database are protected by copyright for the life of the author plus 70 years.

DRM Protection: Full-text documents are served through an encrypted viewer. Any attempt to bypass, disable, or circumvent the Digital Rights Management (DRM) software is a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and will result in permanent expulsion from the Database.

Ownership of Metadata: While the text belongs to the authors, the "Enriched Metadata" (thematic tags, sentiment analysis, and structural outlines generated by our staff) is the property of NovaLit Analytics Inc.

4. Permitted and Prohibited Uses
4.1 Permitted Uses:
Academic Citation: Users may cite short passages from the works in scholarly papers, provided the citation follows standard MLA or APA guidelines.

Private Study: Users may read and annotate texts within the secure browser environment for personal intellectual development.

Discovery: Using the Database to identify books for purchase through external retail links.

4.2 Prohibited Uses:
Mass Downloading: Using automated tools (crawlers, spiders) to harvest text blocks is strictly forbidden.

Derivative Works: You may not use the Database to create "fan fiction," unauthorized translations, or sequels based on the copyrighted works.

Commercial Redistribution: You may not scrape data from this Database to populate your own online bookstore or literary blog without a "Professional Tier" license.

5. Ethical Research and Citation
When using the Database for contemporary literary criticism, the User agrees to:

Acknowledge the Source: Any research paper or publication utilizing data from this archive must include the following credit line: "Statistical data and text samples sourced from the Contemporary Archive (NovaLit Analytics)."

Privacy of Authors: Users shall not use the Database to track the private residential information or personal contact details of living authors, even if such data exists within the administrative metadata.

6. Disclaimer of Literary Accuracy
The Database provides thematic tags (e.g., "Post-Modernism," "Magical Realism," "Climate-Fiction").

Subjectivity: The User acknowledges that literary classification is subjective. NovaLit Analytics does not guarantee that our categorization of a work matches the author’s intent or the User’s personal interpretation.

OCR Errors: Some older contemporary works (1940s–1970s) have been digitized via Optical Character Recognition (OCR). While we strive for 99% accuracy, minor typographical errors may exist in the digital transcripts.

7. Termination and Account Deletion
We reserve the right to suspend any account that exhibits "High-Volume Pattern Behavior," which typically suggests a bot or a shared password.

Notice: Upon suspension, we will provide an email notice allowing the User 48 hours to explain the behavior.

Data Purge: If an account is terminated for a copyright breach, the User must certify in writing that they have destroyed any unauthorized local copies of Database material.

8. Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the federal laws of the United States. Any disputes arising from the use of copyrighted contemporary works shall be settled in the federal courts of the Southern District of New York.
