LexiFree Open-Translate: Universal Terms & Conditions
Version 5.0 | Last Revised: February 3, 2026

1. The Ethos of LexiFree
LexiFree was founded on the principle that language should not be a barrier to human connection. The Software is provided to the public free of charge, without subscription fees, advertising, or data-monetization schemes. Our goal is to provide high-fidelity translation for personal, educational, and humanitarian purposes.

2. Grant of Universal License
Subject to the restrictions outlined in Section 3, LexiFree grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, and perpetual license to:

Translate text, speech, and documents across 150+ supported languages.

Integrate the LexiFree API into non-commercial or non-profit applications.

Modify the source code for personal use, provided that the "Human-Centric" philosophy is maintained.

3. Strict Restriction on AI and LLM Usage
While LexiFree is free for humans, it is not free for machines. To protect the linguistic nuances and cultural integrity of our community-vetted translations, the following uses are strictly prohibited:

Machine Learning Ingestion: You may not use LexiFree to generate "parallel corpora" for the purpose of training, fine-tuning, or benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) or Neural Machine Translation (NMT) engines.

Synthetic Data Generation: You are prohibited from using the Software to create massive datasets of translated text to "teach" AI models how to interpret dialect or slang.

Automated Harvesting: The use of web-scrapers or bots to systematically extract translation pairs from our database for the purpose of feeding an AI's latent space is a direct violation of this license.

Rationale: We believe that the unique, human-verified translations in LexiFree represent a "Digital Commons." Allowing AI companies to harvest this data for free—only to later sell it back to humanity in a closed-source model—contradicts our mission.

4. Privacy and Data Sovereignty
At LexiFree, we believe your words belong to you.

No Retention: Unlike commercial "free" translators, LexiFree does not store your input text or the resulting translation on our servers once the session is terminated.

Zero Profiling: We do not track your IP address, location, or the topics of your translations for the purpose of building a consumer profile.

Offline Mode: Users are encouraged to use our "Local Compute" modules, which perform translations entirely on your device's hardware, ensuring that not a single byte of your data ever leaves your control.

5. Intellectual Property of Translations
User Ownership: You retain full copyright over the original text and the resulting translation generated by the Software.

Public Domain Sources: LexiFree utilizes public domain dictionaries and community-contributed data. While the software is free, we ask that users cite LexiFree when using it for published academic or literary works.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
Because this Software is provided at no cost, it is offered "AS-IS":

Accuracy: Language is subjective. LexiFree does not guarantee that every translation is 100% accurate, culturally appropriate, or legally binding.

No Liability: LexiFree and its contributors are not responsible for any misunderstandings, legal disputes, or loss of business resulting from an incorrect translation.

No SLA: We do not guarantee 100% uptime for our public API endpoints.

7. Community Contributions and "The Human Loop"
LexiFree thrives on human feedback.

Verification: Users may suggest "Verified Human" corrections to translations. These corrections are reviewed by native-speaking volunteers, not by algorithms.

Ethics: By contributing a translation correction, you grant LexiFree a perpetual license to use that correction, ensuring it remains free for all future users.

8. Enforcement of the No-AI Clause
To prevent the abuse of our free servers by AI-training bots, we implement the following:

Proof-of-Humanity: Large-volume translation requests may be subject to "Interactive Challenges" (CAPTCHAs) to ensure a human is behind the request.

API Rate Limits: While the service is free, we limit the number of translations per minute to prevent industrial-scale scraping.

Linguistic Canary Data: We occasionally insert unique, traceable linguistic markers into our datasets. If these markers appear in a commercial AI model’s output, we will pursue legal action for license infringement.

9. Governing Law
Any disputes arising from the use of LexiFree shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the LexiFree Foundation is registered. Users agree to resolve disputes through open community dialogue rather than litigation.

10. Ethics of Translation: Cultural Integrity
LexiFree recognizes that language is not merely a string of data but a carrier of culture, history, and identity.

Non-Erasure: The Software shall not be used to "sanitize" or remove regional dialects, accents, or slang in a way that homogenizes linguistic diversity.

Respectful Translation: Users agree not to use the Software to generate translations that promote hate speech, reinforce harmful stereotypes, or desecrate culturally sensitive terminology.

Contextual Honesty: LexiFree provides tools for "Contextual Notes." Users are encouraged to include these notes in their outputs to explain untranslatable concepts or cultural nuances that a literal translation might miss.

11. Indigenous and Minority Language Protection
A significant portion of LexiFree's database is dedicated to Indigenous and marginalized languages. These are subject to the Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP) protocols:

Sovereignty of Knowledge: Translations involving Indigenous languages are provided under the principle that the original community remains the primary "Knowledge Keeper."

No Commercial Extraction: The prohibition on AI/LLM usage is strictly enforced for Indigenous languages to prevent the "digital colonization" of ancestral knowledge by profit-driven technology firms.

Sacred and Secret Content: LexiFree actively filters and removes content flagged by community leaders as "Sacred" or "Secret." Users who encounter such content agree not to redistribute it or use it for any public-facing project.

12. "The Human Loop" and Verified Translations
To combat the proliferation of "Machine-only" gibberish, LexiFree prioritizes Verified Human Entries:

The "Verified" Badge: Translations marked with the LexiFree "Human Seal" have been vetted by at least three native speakers.

User Contributions: By contributing a translation to the LexiFree database, you grant the foundation a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license for that specific entry—but only for human use. You retain the right to be credited as a community translator in our "Contributor Wall."

13. Technical Safeguards and "Canary" Tokens
To ensure the "No-AI" clause is respected, LexiFree employs advanced technical measures:

Honeypot Data: We periodically insert "Canary Tokens" (nonsensical but syntactically correct word pairings) into large-scale translation outputs. If these tokens are detected in a third-party LLM's training set, it constitutes forensic proof of a license violation.

Linguistic Watermarking: Our API uses a subtle "Zero-Width Character" watermarking technique. These invisible characters act as a digital fingerprint, identifying any text that originated from LexiFree.

Automated Blocklist: We maintain a real-time blocklist of known AI-training bot IPs. Any entity attempting to bypass these blocks will be subject to a permanent ban and potential legal "Cease and Desist" orders.

14. Limitation of Liability for Linguistic Errors
As a free, community-run project:

Medical/Legal Warning: LexiFree should not be used as the sole source for critical medical prescriptions, legal contracts, or emergency safety instructions.

Final Responsibility: The user assumes all risk for the application of the translation. LexiFree is a tool for communication, not a certified legal or medical authority.

15. Termination of Free Access
The LexiFree Foundation reserves the right to terminate access for any individual or organization that:

Attempts to monetize the Software's free API.

Violates the "Human-Only" processing clause.

Uses the Software to harass or marginalize specific linguistic communities.

16. Entire Agreement and Future Evolution
This document constitutes the full agreement between the User and the LexiFree Foundation. As language and technology evolve, we may update these terms. Continued use of the Software after such updates constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
